<p>The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society is pleased to release
    “Public-Private Partnerships for Organizing and Executing
    Prize-Based Competitions,” co-authored by Berkman Center Researcher
    Raymond Tong and Berkman Center Faculty Associate <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/klakhani">Karim R.
      Lakhani</a>, and developed in collaboration with the White House
    Office of Science and Technology Policy. <br />
    </p><p><em>From the Executive Summary:</em></p><p>Prizes can be effective tools for finding innovative solutions to the 
most difficult problems. While prizes are often associated with 
scientific and technological innovation, prizes can also be used to 
foster novel solutions and approaches in much broader contexts, such as 
reducing poverty or finding new ways to educate people.<br />
<br />
Now that the <a title="" href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/about/BILLS-111hr5116enr.pdf">America COMPETES Reauthorization Act</a> has given all 
government departments and agencies broad authority to conduct prize 
competitions, agencies may find themselves looking for resources to 
learn about prizes and challenges. This paper describes how government 
agencies can design, build, and execute effective prizes – though these 
models can easily be adapted to meet the needs of foundations, public 
interest groups, private companies, and a host of other entities with an
 interest in spurring innovation.<br />
<br />
As an informational guide to promote the use of prizes within government
 agencies, with an emphasis on opportunities to form different types of 
private-public partnerships, this paper:<br />
</p><ul><li>
Provides an overview of the prize lifecycle to help agencies better 
understand when to use prizes and the various elements involved in 
developing a prize;</li><li>Presents a framework outlining the various roles agencies can fill in
 the prize process and the importance of using partnerships to maximize 
the effectiveness of a prize; and,</li><li>Highlights important steps and considerations regarding partnerships with other organizations.<br /></li></ul><p>
Drawing on interviews and secondary research on existing prizes that 
rely on multi-sector partnerships, it explores every aspect of forming 
partnerships and implementing prizes across the broad range of 
activities that occur within various stages of the prize lifecycle.<br />
<br />
While prizes may not be suited to solve every type of problem, they 
offer a powerful complement to govern­ment agencies’ traditional 
channels of innovation. As the use of prizes in the government sector 
increases, new practices and novel ways of structuring contests and 
partnerships will undoubtedly emerge. To share best practices, agencies 
are encouraged to collaborate by offering lessons learned from previous 
competitions and seeking opportunities to assist other agencies in 
conducting prizes when objectives overlap.<br />
